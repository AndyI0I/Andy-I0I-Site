      <br><br>
      Today I realized that I should have modularized everything in theory, which would otherwise lead to redundant code, like the footer, header and of course, my side-bar.
      <br><br>
      but unfortunately i can't just do that because otherwise my css is gone and half of it only works and the page only looks half as good.
      <br>
      I wanted to do it that way, but then I prefer to do it that way, that I have a template document somewhere, where I can then edit everything nicely myself.
      <br><br>
      At least, the website I have designed so that all the new content, only in the "Main" may be written. So I only have to copy one page and delete and edit everything that is in the "Main".
